# RecQ #
Published by School of Software Engineering, Chongqing University
###Introduction##
**RecQ** is a Python library for recommender systems (Python 2.7.x). It implements a suit of state-of-the-art recommendations. To run RecQ easily, the leading open data science platform  [**Anaconda**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is strongly recommended. It integrates Python interpreter, common scientific computing library (such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib), and package manager.
###Architecture of RecQ###

To design it, we borrow some thoughts from another recommender system library [**LibRec**](https://github.com/guoguibing/librec), which is implemented with Java.

###Features###
* **Cross-platform**: as a Python software, RecQ can be easily deployed and executed in any platforms, including MS Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
* **Fast execution**: RecQ is based on the fast scientific computing libraries such as Numpy and some light common data structures, which make it runs much faster than other libraries based on Python.
* **Easy configuration**: RecQ configs recommenders using a configuration file.
* **Easy expansion**: RecQ provides a set of well-designed recommendation interfaces by which new algorithms can be easily implemented.
